# Analysis of Loan Repayment Terms of Different Banks Using Excel

## Overview

This project provides a comparative analysis of loan repayment plans for the same loan amount taken from different banks. In today's financial landscape, both individuals and businesses frequently utilize bank loans to meet their financial needs. However, banks vary significantly in terms of interest rates, total repayment amounts, additional charges, and annual cost rates. Therefore, choosing the most suitable loan option is essential for borrowers.

## Methodology

In this project, repayment plans for a 100,000 TL loan with a 24-month term were created using Excel. Financial functions such as PMT were used to calculate:

- Monthly installment amounts  
- Interest payments  
- Principal repayments  
- Total repayment amounts  

Additional charges like taxes (KKDF, BSMV) were also considered for each bank.

## Result

This analysis helped to identify significant differences in loan costs among different banks. As a result, the most advantageous loan option was determined. This project can guide users in making more informed financial decisions when comparing loan offers.

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel  
- PMT and other financial formulas
